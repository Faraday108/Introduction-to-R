# R Nuts and Bolts
## Entering Input
We type expressions into the R prompt. 
The <- symbol is the assignment operator
```{r}
x <- 5 # Assignment of value to variable
print(x) # Explicit printing
x # auto-printing
y <- 10:20
```
When [1] is printed it indicates that x is a vector and that 5 is the first element
The : operator is used to create integer sequences
